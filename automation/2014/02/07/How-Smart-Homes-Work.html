		<p>How Smart Homes Work?</p>

<p>In busy routine days, we often found overselevs in situation when we are not sure about we took enough care to turn off coffee maker, and did not turn on our security alarm system before leaving our house, being involved a lot in social life we want to care about student&#39;s study, if they are doing their homework or just watching their favourite cartoon channel on television.</p>

<p>There comes a smart home concept, to help you take care of most of such situations as explained just above, and we can be worries free by following smart home. In general we can connect to various devices and appliances in our home to manage and control their actions as and when needed or schedule certain tasks / actions on defined intervals or events. It is also possible to have those devices and appliances communicate with each other, how does that sound?
Yes it can communicate for sure with proper setup you have in your home.</p>

<p>Any device in your home that uses electricity can be put on your home network and at your command.
To give command there are various ways like: voice, remove control, and now a days increasing use of tablets and smart phones.
Real example of smart home implementations are related to lighting, home security, home theater and entertainment, and thermostat regulation.</p>

<p>People may say smart home implementations are very much expensive, but I would say you need to think about what do you get in return while having them implemented in your home. That is the reason smart homes and home automation are becoming more common.</p>

<p>Now a days lot of companies are coming up with variety of solutions for smart home, and that gives an idea from the business perspective that future will be more brighter with such products. I am not mentioning those counts, amounts etc., for that you may google and get latest and uptodate information from various source on the internet for sure.</p>

<p>Also we must not forget about the big factor which give more confidence to draw huge business to companies, and that is is due to the jaw-dropping success of smartphones and tablet computers. These ultra-portable computers are everywhere, and their constant Internet connections means they can be configured to handle lot of activites you want to perform with devices and appliances in your home. All of the electronics in your home are fair game for this tech revolution, from your fridge to your furnace.</p>

<p>Smart Home Software and Technology:</p>

<p>Two of the most prominent radio networks in home automation are ZigBee and Z-Wave. Both of these technologies are mesh networks, meaning there&#39;s more than one way for the message to get to its destination.</p>

<p>Setting Up a Smart Home:</p>

<p>Here are some examples of smart home products and their functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras will track your home&#39;s exterior even if it&#39;s pitch-black outside</li>
<li>You can control a thermostat from your bed, the airport, anywhere your smartphone has a signal</li>
<li>LED lights let you program color and brightness right from your smartphone</li>
<li>Motion sensors will send an alert when there&#39;s motion around your house, and they can even tell the difference between pets and burglars</li>
<li>Smartphone integration lets you turn lights and appliances on or off from your mobile device</li>
<li>Door locks and garage doors can open automatically as your smartphone approaches</li>
<li>Auto alerts from your security system will immediately go to your smartphone, so you instantly know if there&#39;s a problem at home</li>
<li>Many devices also come with built-in web servers that allow you to access their information online</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds funny but interesting enoug to know about Smart appliances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trash cans that monitor what you throw away and generate online orders for replacements.</li>
<li>Refrigerators that create dinner recipes based on the ingredients stored inside.</li>
<li>Washers and dryers that send text message alerts when their cycle has ended.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general home automation does not just mean to turn on / off the device or appliances but it is also useful in data analysis and notification process, that is indeed justifies the term SMART with home, which is &quot;Smart Home.&quot;</p>
